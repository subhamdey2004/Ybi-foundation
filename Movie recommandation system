Project Title: Predicting House Prices
Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate house prices based on various features such as the size of the house, the number of bedrooms, the location, and other relevant factors.

Data Source
The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle House Prices dataset.

Import Libraries

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

Import Data

data = pd.read_csv('house_prices.csv')

Describe Data

data.info()
data.describe()
data.head()

Data Visualization
Distribution of Target Variable

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))

plt.show()

Pairplot of Selected Features

selected_features = ['OverallQual', 'GrLivArea', 'GarageCars', 'TotalBsmtSF', 'FullBath', 'YearBuilt']
sns.pairplot(data[selected_features + ['SalePrice']])
plt.show()

Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values

data = data.fillna(data.mean()) # Simple imputation for missing values

Encoding Categorical Variables

data = pd.get_dummies(data, drop_first=True)

Define Target Variable (y) and Feature Variables (X)

X = data.drop('SalePrice', axis=1)
y = data['SalePrice']

Train Test Split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

Modeling
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

Model Evaluation

y_train_pred = model.predict(X_train)
mse_train = mean_squared_error(y_train, y_train_pred)
r2_train = r2_score(y_train, y_train_pred)

mse_test = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_test_pred)
r2_test = r2_score(y_test, y_test_pred)

print(f'Test R2 Score: {r2_test}')

Prediction

Predicting house prices for the test set
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
predictions[:5] # Display first 5 predictions

Explanation
In this project, we developed a predictive model to estimate house prices using various features. After preprocessing the data, we trained a linear regression model and evaluated its performance using mean squared error and R-squared metrics. The model showed a decent fit on the training data and provided reasonable predictions on the test data. Further improvements could include trying more sophisticated models, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning to enhance predictive performance.

Title of Project:
Predicting Women's Clothing Reviews using Multinomial na√Øve Bayes

Objective:
To develop a predictive model using Multinomial na√Øve Bayes algorithm to classify women's clothing reviews into multiple categories based on their content.

Data Source:

The dataset containing women's clothing reviews, possibly sourced from online retailers or public datasets.

Import library:

pandas for data manipulation and analysis
nltk (Natural Language Toolkit) for text processing
sklearn for implementing the Multinomial na√Øve Bayes classifier and evaluation metrics
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization

Import Data:

Load the women's clothing reviews dataset into your environment.

Describe Data:

Explore the structure and content of the dataset.
Preprocess the text data by removing stopwords, punctuation, and performing tokenization.
Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of reviews across different categories and extract relevant features.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Data Visualization:

Visualize the distribution of target variable (if categorical) and feature variables using histograms, bar plots, or pie charts.
Explore relationships between variables using scatter plots, pair plots, or correlation matrices.
Identify any patterns or trends in the data that may be relevant for the predictive modeling task.

Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values by imputation or removal, depending on the extent of missingness and the nature of the data.
Perform feature scaling or normalization if necessary to ensure that all features have a similar scale.
Encode categorical variables into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Optionally, perform feature engineering to create new features that may enhance the predictive power of the model.

Optionally, perform feature engineering to create new features that may enhance the predictive power of the model.
Define Target Variable (y) and Feature Variables (X):

Identify the target variable (y) that you want to predict, which in this case would likely be the category or sentiment of the clothing reviews.
Select the feature variables (X) that will be used to predict the target variable. These may include various attributes or characteristics of the reviews, such as text content, ratings, or other metadata.

Train Test Split:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the predictive model.
Typically, a common split ratio is 70-30 or 80-20 for training and testing, respectively.
Ensure that the distribution of classes in the target variable is balanced across both the training and testing sets.

Modeling:

Instantiate a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier from the scikit-learn library.
Fit the classifier to the training data (X_train, y_train) to learn the patterns in the data.
Optionally, you can explore other classifiers or algorithms to compare their performance with Multinomial Naive Bayes.

Model Evaluation:

After training the model, evaluate its performance on the test data (X_test, y_test).
Calculate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's effectiveness.
Visualize the evaluation results using appropriate plots or tables for better interpretation.

Prediction:

Once the model is trained and evaluated, use it to make predictions on new or unseen data.
Apply the trained model to the feature variables (X_test) to predict the target variable (y_pred).
Optionally, you can also compute probabilities or confidence scores for each prediction.

Explanation:

Provide insights into the factors contributing to the model's predictions.
Explain how the model utilizes features to classify women's clothing reviews into different categories.
Discuss any limitations or assumptions of the model and potential areas for improvement
